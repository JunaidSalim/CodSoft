This repository contains tasks/projects in C++ of my remote internship at CodSoft.

## Task 1: Number Guessing Game

In this task, you'll find a C++ program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, guiding the user to the correct number. The user continues guessing until they guess the correct number.

## Task 2: Basic Calculator

This task includes a C++ program that acts as a basic calculator. It allows users to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). The program then performs the selected operation on the input numbers and displays the result.

## Task 3: Console-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game

In this task, you'll find a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Two players can take turns marking spaces on the game board, attempting to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game provides a fun way to practice C++ logic and control flow.

Feel free to explore each task's code, run the programs, and modify them as you learn. These tasks are designed to help you build your programming skills and gain hands-on experience with C++.

Happy coding!
